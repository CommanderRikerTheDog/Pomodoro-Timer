""" EVENT-DRIVEN:
We can't use the time's countdown mechanism in Tkinter because it requires a while loop. 
This interferes with GUI programs because GUIs require a mainloop to "keep watch" of a screen, meaning
these are Event Driven. Any other loop will break that. 

We'll use window.after() method from tkinter to tell it to:
- wait one second
- a function to call after 1000 milliseconds

WORKING WITH IMAGES

This is where the PIL was needed. This library was tricky to install.
1. From terminal: pip install pillow
2. To tap into the library, you use PIL

Opening & Resizing takes multiple steps:
1. Open with Image.open(filenamehere)
2. Create resize variable containing the width & height parameters as a tuple; I used floor division for simplicity. 
3. Use the .resize() method from the Image class, then feed in the resize tuple from #2.
4. Convert #3 to an ImageTk object in order to use that on the canvas later.
